            on a professional level, my journey has been shaped by a fusion of creativity, adaptability, and a passion for leadership.
            <br><br> i am currently in my final year of pursuing a bachelor's degree in computer science and engineering (B.Tech).
            <br><br>
            i am proficient in python and have mentored students in the language. 
            aditionally, my experience extends to the development of innovative 
            solutions, evidenced by projects like Wildpatron and EquiID.
            these projects not only showcase my technical skills but also 
            demonstrate my ability to think creatively and solve real-world problems.
            <br><br>i've actively engaged with communities like GDSC and IEEE, serving as the innovation co-lead at GDSC GECT for the year 2022-23. 
            <br><br>furthermore, i had the privilege of being a speaker at the blockchain workshop during the IEDC summit 2023 held at the college of engineering trivandrum. 
            <br><br>i've participated in various hackathons, including ETHIndia and WMN by devfolio. our team was a finalist at the greenpill festival hackathon and we won the best project in the polygon + ethereum track at WMN hackathon by devfolio.
            <br><br>however, beyond the technical realms, I find my inspiration in capturing moments through photography, expressing myself through art, and immersing myself in the soothing world of music.
